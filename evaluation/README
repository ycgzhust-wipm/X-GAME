1) inter-plddt.py

This script is used to extract the pLDDT values of cross-linking sites (CA atoms) from PDB complex structures predicted by AlphaFold2.

### Input

The input file, xlms.dat, contains four columns of information:

UniProt ID of protein A
UniProt ID of protein B
Site on protein A
Site on protein B

### Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command:

python3 inter-plddt.py

The program will use the information from xlms.dat to calculate the pLDDT values for the corresponding PDB files in the current directory, and output the results to a file named output-plddt.txt. 
The PDB files should follow the naming format proteinA_proteinB_1.pdb, where proteinA and proteinB are the UniProt IDs of the respective proteins. 
By default, the first model from the AlphaFold2 output is used.

### Output

The output file will contain six columns of information:

The first four columns will match the input file (xlms.dat).
The fifth and sixth columns will contain the pLDDT values for the sites listed in the third and fourth columns.
If an amino acid cannot be found in the PDB structure or the corresponding PDB file is missing, “NA” will be output for that position.

2) inter-distance.py

This script is used to calculate the distances between inter-molecular cross-linking sites (CA atoms) from PDB complex structures predicted by AlphaFold2.

### Input

The input file, xlms.dat, contains four columns of information:

UniProt ID of protein A
UniProt ID of protein B
Site on protein A
Site on protein B

### Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command:

python3 inter-distance.py

The program will use the information from xlms.dat to calculate the distances for the corresponding PDB files in the current directory, and output the results to a file named output-distance.txt.
The PDB files should follow the naming format proteinA_proteinB_x.pdb, where proteinA and proteinB are the UniProt IDs of the respective proteins.
Since AlphaFold2 typically outputs five models, 'x' represents the model number, ranging from 1 to 5.

### Output

The output file will contain nine columns of information:

The first four columns will match the input file (xlms.dat).
Columns five to nine represent the distances between the corresponding sites across different models.
If an amino acid cannot be found in the PDB structure or the corresponding PDB file is missing, '0.00' will be output for that position.
